# veld executable placeholder folder

In case this veld executable is run alone and not in the context of a chain, this folder here can 
be used out of the box, for testing, development, ad hoc usage.

Should this executable be used in veld chain, then this folder must be ignored and a volume in the
chain's veld.yaml must overwrite the mount in the veld.yaml's services section.
